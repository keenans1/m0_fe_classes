# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

new challenges are fun and exciting
especially when you don't immediately know the answer and have to work that brain!

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

workflow is good, Trello is a great help

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

make sure there are no outside distractions, pay attention in class, and use all resources!
definitely need the support of class mates
